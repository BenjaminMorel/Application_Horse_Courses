# Application Horse Courses

## Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a mobile application, and, in a second step, to store the
application data inside the cloud. For this, we will use respectively Android and Firebase.

## Application features
The application that you will develop must include the following features:
- User interface allowing to:
  - Show the dataset information
  - Change/Delete this information
  - Add new data
- Action bar (or navigation drawer using fragments)
- Settings, allowing to display an About information (information about the App) and other useful settings
- Correct management of activities
- Correct navigation hierarchy
- Storing data on the phone using Googleâ€™s Room API, and not on the cloud (1st part of project)
- Storing data inside Google cloud using Firebase (2nd part of project)
- Other useful features to make your application coherent and attractive
- The code must be self-documented and self-explaining
